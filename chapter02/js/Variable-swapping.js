// JavaScript code goes here

// Variable swapping

// Observe the following program.

// Add the necessary code to swap the values of variables number1 and number2.

// T> This exercise has several valid solutions. You may use more than two variables to solve it.

let number1 = 5;
let number2 = 3;

// TODO: type your code here (and nowhere else!)
let number3 = number1;
number1 = number2;
number2 = number3;



console.log(number1); // Should show 3
console.log(number2); // Should show 5
